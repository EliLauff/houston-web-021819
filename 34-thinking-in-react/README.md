# Thinking in React

### Pain Points in React
* Errors range from super clear to vodoo nonsense
* Collaboration between different files / components
* Using the spread operator can be confusing
* Accessing a particular variable
* What you can put in your `render` method
* `this` just in general
* What to do when and why and where?
* Should we have a constructor?
* Components as functions vs classes?
* You have to plan before you start building


### Key Questions
* How do we start?
    * `create-react-app`
* What are the basic visual units of my app?
    * App
        * War
            * DragonCard []  
        * Home
            * DragonCard []
* What would a static version look like?
    * Build it!
* What is the basic data hierarchy of my app?
    * What changes?
        * Dragon (at home/war)
        * Number of dragons to render
            * Names of those dragons would change
            * Images of those dragons would change
            * Descriptions of those dragons would change
